**Title: NLP Projects â€“ My-first-nlp-project**

This repository contains a complete NLP mini-project series built using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. All work was done as part of a self-paced Udemy learning experience, with a focus on practical understanding and implementation.

**Project Highlights**

Custom Tokenizer created from scratch

Built stoi (string-to-index) and itos (index-to-string) dictionaries

Applied tokenization logic to sample texts and datasets

Developed modular notebook code to simulate NLP pipelines

**Project Structure**

File/Notebook

Tokenizer.json-	  Stores vocabulary mapping (stoi and itos)

PART 1.ipynb-	    Introduction to tokenization and vocabulary building

PART 2.ipynb-	    Continued tokenizer logic with examples

PART 3.ipynb-	    Text cleaning and preprocessing tasks

PART 4.ipynb-	    Applying tokenizer to input pipelines

PART 5.ipynb-	    Handling unknown tokens and padding

PART 6.ipynb-	    Model preparation logic

PART 7.ipynb-	    Full data pipeline assembly

PART 8.ipynb-	    Final optimization and testing

**Tech Used**

Python

Jupyter Notebook

JSON

NLP Concepts (Tokenizer, Vocab Mapping, Preprocessing)

**Learning Journey**

This project is based on concepts learned from a Udemy NLP course. Although no certificate was issued, all code and logic were implemented independently as part of personal learning and practice.

**Goals**

Solidify NLP foundations through hands-on work

Simulate real-world preprocessing pipelines
